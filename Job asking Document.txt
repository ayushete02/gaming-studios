Hi,

My name is Ayush Shete and I am a Frontend Developer and Blockchain Developer from Shri Ramdeobaba College of Engineering and Management, graduating in 2024. I am writing to inquire about any openings for fresher interns at Persistent. My achievements include five Web3 Hackathon victories, as well as the SIH22 Hackathon Winner sponsored by Persistent, along with receiving notification from Persistent that they offer jobs to SIH winners. I have included my resume with this message - I would be honored to be considered for Developer positions.   

Thank you for your time,   

Ayush Shete
