# Introduction
Trustpoint is a decentralized application that enables organizations and celebrities to come together and create deals. The Trustpoint dApp allows organizations to view registered celebrities and negotiate deals with them. After creating a deal, a new ERC 1155 NFT is created with the provided metadata, and the organization can mint this NFT to anyone.

# Flow 

## Registration
To start using TrustPoint, organizations and celebrities need to register on the dApp by providing their personal and contact information. This will include their name, email address, and any relevant social media accounts.

## Chat and Negotiate
Once registered, organizations can view all the registered celebrities and start a chat with them. They can then negotiate the deal and create a deal object on the deal controller smart contract. The organization will be required to provide NFT metadata, one-off fees for the deal, and royalty information for both parties.

## Deal Creation
After the negotiations are complete, the organization can choose to create a deal by submitting the required inputs to the deal controller smart contract. The deal will be created from the organization's side and will include all the relevant information regarding the proposed collaboration.

## Deal Cancellation
Before the celebrity accepts the deal, the organization has the option to cancel it. If the celebrity accepts the deal first, a new ERC 1155 NFT will be created with the provided metadata.

## NFT Minting
Once the NFT is created, the organization can mint it to anyone. This will enable them to integrate the celebrity's likeness or image into their games.
